        <h3>Everything in the Model matters and should be accounted for.</h3>

<p>The model is the contract between the controller and the view. It describes what the controller logic expects and what the view logic renders. Everything in the model should be set by the controller. Everything in the model should be present in the view. Everything in the model should be able to be used by the controller after post.</p>

<h3>Always include @Html.ValidationMessage("Error") somewhere in every form.</h3>

<p>This is where I'll pass catch-all errors that don't pertain to a particular field.</p>

<h3>Test all lists with 0 items, 1 item, and BUNCHES of items.</h3>

<p>Lists with zero items should always display a message letting the user know there is none. Lists with one item should have the appropriate pluralization considerations different from 0 or 2+.  BUNCHES of items should be tested to get a grasp on paging concerns and list length.</p>

<h3>All lists should have an indication of how many items are in the list.</h3>

<p>This seems trivial with one or two items, but is critical when there are more ... or even when there are zero. It's helpful to the users.</p>
